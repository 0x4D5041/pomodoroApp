# Pomodoro App

This is a Pomodoro App built using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The app allows users to set a timer for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and then repeat the process. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, which is used to improve productivity and time management.

It is possible to create an account to store data such as the time for each pomodoro and break. This data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

To test the application, please go to the following link ~> [Pomodoro App at Netlify](0x4d5041pomodoroapp.netlify.app/)

The app can work without the need for an account, but if you want to use one, you can easily create it.
